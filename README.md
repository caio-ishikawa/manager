# Manager (Work in Progress || Placeholder Name) #

Manager is a Discord-inspired collaboration desktop app, which allows users to create servers (similar to Discord), add users to it, conduct conversations, upload documents, and to privately chat with any user in your friends list.

## Technologies ##
- MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS).
- Web Sockets for real-time chatting (Socket.io).
- Multer for file uploads.
- AWS for storing images/files.

TODO:
- Refactor ProjectView.
- Profile route.
- Replace activity view with voice chat.


## KNOWN BUGS ##
- ~~Messages get rendered more than once sometimes (They are NOT getting sent multiple times to the DB, so it must be a rendering bug)~~ (FIXED)

### TODO: ###
